## Scope Freeze (Current)

- Frontend preset selection is disabled (React is fixed).
- DB preset selection is disabled (Prisma/Postgres is fixed).
- Docker is always generated; runtime proxy is selectable (`caddy|nginx|none`).
- DB preset flags may return in a future milestone after `db-prisma` is separated into an explicit preset/module flow.
